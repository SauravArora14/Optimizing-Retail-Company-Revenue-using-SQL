Aggregate functions: These functions facilitate the calculation of values across multiple rows of data, including operations like sum, average, and count.
Date functions: These functions provide the means to manipulate and extract information from date columns within the database.
Join functions: These functions empower me to merge data from different tables based on shared columns.
Union functions: These functions permit the merging of outcomes from various queries into a single result set.
CTE (Common Table Expression): This function empowers me to establish a temporary result set within a SELECT statement.
Subqueries: These represent SELECT statements executed within another SELECT statement.
Window functions: These functions empower me to conduct calculations across a group of rows.
